   - Click the **Advanced** or **Settings** option to open more detailed settings.

3. **Re-Enable the Headphone Popup**:

   - Look for an option that says **"Show Popup When Device Is Connected"** (or something similar).
   - Check the box to ensure the popup appears when a new device, such as headphones, is plugged in.
   - If you can't find this option, explore the **Playback** or **Device** tab within the MaxxAudio app, as these settings sometimes vary by model.

4. **Test the Headphones**:

   - The MaxxAudio popup should now appear, allowing you to select the correct device type (usually "Headphones" or "Headset").
   - Make sure to choose the appropriate device type to restore sound functionality.

## If the Problem Persists

If re-enabling the MaxxAudio popup does not solve the issue and the headphones still donâ€™t work, the problem may lie with the headphone jack itself. In this case, the laptop will need to be taken to tech support for further diagnosis and possible repair.
